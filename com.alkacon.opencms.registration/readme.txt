1. Module functions

With the Webuser Registration module it is possible to easily create both,
a webuser registration form and a webuser profile edition form. This is a
common requirement in modern websites that can now be easily configured in 
OpenCms. The forms have all functionalities provided by the webforms module,
like configurable input fields, confirmation page, captcha field and 
confirmation email. Additionally you can use an 'activation link' to have
users confirming the registration, before activating the account.
This module also includes two additional page elements, one small frontend 
login form and an information box about the registered and online users.
